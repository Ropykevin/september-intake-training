	CSS Padding
The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
	Padding - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
	The position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
There are five different position values:
static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky
Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
