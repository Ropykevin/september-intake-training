I can describe how to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for an e-commerce system, but I can't actually draw diagrams. However, I can provide you with a textual representation of what the ERD might look like.

In an e-commerce ERD, you would typically have entities like:

1. **User**: This entity represents the users of the e-commerce system. It might have attributes like UserID, Username, Email, Password, and more.

2. **Product**: This entity represents the products available for sale. Attributes could include ProductID, ProductName, Description, Price, and StockQuantity.

3. **Category**: Categories can be used to organize products. It might have attributes like CategoryID and CategoryName.

4. **Order**: This entity represents customer orders. Attributes could include OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, and OrderStatus.

5. **Payment**: This entity could represent payment information for orders. Attributes might include PaymentID, PaymentDate, PaymentMethod, and Amount.

6. **Address**: Customers typically have shipping and billing addresses. Attributes could include AddressID, StreetAddress, City, State, ZIPCode, and Country.

7. **Cart**: This entity represents the shopping cart of a user, with attributes like CartID, UserID, and Status.

8. **Review/Rating**: If your e-commerce system allows customers to review and rate products, you might have an entity for this with attributes like ReviewID, ProductID, UserID, Rating, and Comment.

Here's a simplified textual representation of the relationships:

- Users can place Orders, and each Order belongs to a User.
- Products can belong to one or more Categories.
- Users can have multiple Addresses for shipping and billing.
- Users can have one or more Reviews for products.
- Users can add Products to their Cart, and each Cart belongs to a User.
- Orders can have one or more Products, and Products can be part of one or more Orders.
- Orders are associated with Payments.

This is a basic outline of an e-commerce ERD. Depending on the complexity of your e-commerce system, you may need to add more entities and relationships to capture all the necessary information and business rules. You can use diagramming tools or software like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even a pen and paper to create a visual representation of this ERD.
